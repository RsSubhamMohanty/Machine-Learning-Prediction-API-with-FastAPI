# Machine-Learning-Prediction-API-with-FastAPI
This project is a complete end-to-end MLOps demonstration. It involves training a machine learning model to solve a specific problem [&lt;-- State the problem, e.g., "predict customer churn" or "classify iris species"] and deploying it as a REST API using FastAPI.The project showcases skills in model training, API development, and data versioning.
